title: Replace Week with Today Goal
area: ui
files:

## Problem

Home screen shows "Week" statistics but the app is focused on daily goals (50 push-ups/day). Users need to see today's progress more prominently.

## Solution

Replace "Week" section with "Today Goal" showing progress toward the 50 push-up daily target.
