# Phase 03.3: Weekly Goals System - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-25
**Status:** Ready for planning

## Phase Boundary

Users work toward weekly targets (daily goal × 5) with Sunday review popup, receive bonus points for reaching weekly target, and can choose to increase/decrease their goal for next week. Streak handling modified so that any push-ups in a week preserve streak (only 0 workouts resets it).

## Implementation Decisions

### Sunday Popup Design
- **Timing:** Auto-show when user opens app on Sunday (no notification tap required)
- **Content:** Full stats breakdown - Completed / Weekly Target, percentage, progress bar, bonus points notice if achieved
- **Dismiss behavior:** Mandatory selection - user must select an option to dismiss
- **When target missed:** Show encouragement + offer reduction option (-10%, -20%, or -30% tiers)
- **Early achievement:** If user hits target before Sunday (e.g., Wednesday), popup shows immediately

### Weekly Bonus Timing
- **Trigger:** 500 bonus points awarded when popup shows (not delayed until Sunday end)
- **Excess push-ups:** Scaled bonus for overachievement (Claude's discretion on exact formula)
- **Early achievement:** Popup shows immediately when weekly target is hit mid-week

### Goal Increase Options
- **When target achieved:** Offer maintain / +10% / +20% options
- **When target missed:** Offer -10% / -20% / -30% reduction options (multiple tiers)
- **Preview:** Show months to reach 50 push-ups for each option
- **Minimum/maximum:** Claude's discretion for reasonable bounds

### Streak Preservation Rules
- **Evaluation:** Real-time tracking - any push-ups in current week automatically preserve streak
- **Minimum threshold:** Any push-ups count (even 1+)
- **Week boundary:** Monday starts new week, Sunday ends current week
- **Streak freeze interaction:** Freeze only used if 0 push-ups in entire week (real-time preservation is primary)

### Claude's Discretion
- **Overachievement bonus formula:** Exact scaling calculation for excess push-ups beyond weekly target
- **Goal bounds:** Reasonable minimum/maximum limits for weekly goal changes
- **Progress bar design:** Exact visual implementation in the popup

## Specific Ideas

- Popup must be mandatory selection - user can't ignore the weekly review
- Early achievement triggers immediate popup - don't wait until Sunday
- Multiple reduction tiers based on how much user missed their target
- Show projection (months to 50) for each goal option
- Real-time streak preservation - don't wait until Sunday to evaluate

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope
