# Plan 04.4-01: Configure pubspec.yaml for Adaptive Icons

**Phase**: 04.4 - Android Adaptive Icon
**Wave**: 1
**Autonomous**: true

---

## Objective

Configure pubspec.yaml to generate Android Adaptive Icons with:
- Orange background (#FF6B00 - AppColors.primaryOrange)
- Foreground layer with app logo

## Context

The current icon.png is a full square icon. For adaptive icons, we need a foreground asset with a transparent background. The icon.png will serve as the foreground, and flutter_launcher_icons will composite it with the orange background.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create foreground asset directory
- Create `assets/launcher/adaptive/` directory
- Copy existing `icon.png` to `icon_foreground.png` as the foreground layer
- The foreground will be composited with orange background by flutter_launcher_icons

### Task 2: Update pubspec.yaml flutter_launcher_icons configuration
Change from:
```yaml
flutter_launcher_icons:
  android: true
  ios: false
  image_path: "assets/launcher/icon.png"
  adaptive_icon_background: "#000000"
  adaptive_icon_foreground: "assets/launcher/icon.png"
  min_sdk_android: 21
```

To:
```yaml
flutter_launcher_icons:
  android: true
  ios: false
  image_path: "assets/launcher/icon.png"
  adaptive_icon_background: "#FF6B00"
  adaptive_icon_foreground: "assets/launcher/icon.png"
  min_sdk_android: 21
```

Key change: `adaptive_icon_background` from `#000000` to `#FF6B00`

### Task 3: Update assets in pubspec.yaml
Ensure `assets/launcher/` is in flutter assets section (already exists).

## Verification

- [ ] Directory `assets/launcher/adaptive/` exists
- [ ] pubspec.yaml has `adaptive_icon_background: "#FF6B00"`
- [ ] pubspec.yaml has `adaptive_icon_foreground: "assets/launcher/icon.png"`
- [ ] `flutter pub get` completes without errors

## Success Criteria

1. pubspec.yaml is configured for adaptive icons with orange background
2. Assets path is correct
3. Configuration is valid (flutter_launcher_icons can parse it)

## Notes

- The icon.png already has the logo centered on a dark background
- flutter_launcher_icons will handle generating all the adaptive icon XML files
- Orange #FF6B00 matches AppColors.primaryOrange
