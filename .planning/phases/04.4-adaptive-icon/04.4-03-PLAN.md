# Plan 04.4-03: Verify Adaptive Icons on Android

**Phase**: 04.4 - Android Adaptive Icon
**Wave**: 3
**Autonomous**: false
**Depends on**: 04.4-01, 04.4-02

---

## Objective

Build the app and verify adaptive icons display correctly on Android emulator/device.

## Context

After generating adaptive icons, we need to:
1. Build the app
2. Install on Android device/emulator
3. Verify icon appears correctly
4. Check different launcher shapes if possible

## Tasks

### Task 1: Clean and build APK
```bash
cd push_up_5050
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --debug
```

### Task 2: Install and check icon
```bash
flutter install
```

Then verify:
1. App icon appears in launcher
2. Icon shows orange background with logo
3. Icon is clearly visible

### Task 3: Document verification
Note:
- Device/emulator used
- Android version
- Launcher type (if known)
- Icon appearance

## Checkpoint

After building and installing, present a checkpoint for user verification:

**Checkpoint: Visual Verification**

The adaptive icon has been generated and the app built. Please verify:

1. Install the APK on your Android device
2. Check the app icon in the launcher
3. Note the launcher shape (round, square, squircle, etc.)
4. Confirm whether the icon displays correctly

**Awaiting**: User confirms icon appearance or reports issues

## Success Criteria

1. APK builds successfully with adaptive icons
2. App icon displays with orange background (#FF6B00)
3. Logo is visible on the adaptive icon
4. Icon adapts to launcher shape

## Notes

- Physical device recommended for full verification (various launcher shapes)
- Android 8.0+ (API 26+) shows adaptive icons; earlier versions show legacy PNG
- If icon has issues, we may need to adjust the foreground asset
- Common issues:
  - Foreground too large/small → adjust padding
  - Foreground not visible → check contrast with orange background
  - Background wrong color → check XML file
