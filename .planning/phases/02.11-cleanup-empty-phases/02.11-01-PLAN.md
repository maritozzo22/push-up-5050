# Phase 02.11-01: Clean Up Empty Phase Directories

**Created:** 2026-01-23
**Status:** PLANNED
**Wave:** 1 (single autonomous plan)
**Depends on:** Phase 02.10 (should be run after ROADMAP update is complete)

## Goal

Remove empty placeholder phase directories and ensure all phase directories contain actual plan files.

## Context

Previous gap closure phases (02.10, 02.11, 02.12) were created as empty placeholder directories with ROADMAP.md entries but no actual plans. After Phase 02.10 creates new plans:
- Old 02.10 becomes "02.10-update-roadmap-statuses" (now has plan)
- Old 02.11 becomes "02.11-cleanup-empty-phases" (this phase)
- Old 02.12 was removed (TODOs deferred)

This phase ensures no empty directories remain after the reorganization.

## Tasks

1. **Verify Phase 02.10 Has Content**
   - Confirm 02.10-01-PLAN.md exists
   - Confirm plan was executed (SUMMARY.md exists)

2. **Verify Phase 02.11 Has Content**
   - Confirm this plan file exists
   - After execution, confirm SUMMARY.md exists

3. **Check for Any Remaining Empty Directories**
   - List all directories in `.planning/phases/`
   - Identify any with no PLAN.md files
   - Remove or populate as appropriate

4. **Update ROADMAP.md (if needed)**
   - Remove references to deleted phase 02.12
   - Ensure all remaining phases have valid entries

## Execution Steps

1. After Phase 02.10 is complete, verify its directory has content
2. Execute this phase (create SUMMARY.md after completion)
3. Check for any remaining empty phase directories
4. Clean up as needed

## Deliverables

- Clean phases directory with no empty folders
- All phase directories contain at least one PLAN.md file

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Phase 02.10 directory contains PLAN.md and SUMMARY.md
- [ ] Phase 02.11 directory contains PLAN.md and SUMMARY.md
- [ ] No empty phase directories remain
- [ ] ROADMAP.md has no references to deleted phase 02.12

## Dependencies

- Phase 02.10 should be executed first (to populate the renamed directory)

## Success Criteria

- All phase directories have content
- No placeholder directories remain
- ROADMAP.md is consistent with actual directory structure
