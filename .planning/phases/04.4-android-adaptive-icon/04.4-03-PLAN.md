<objective>
Verify adaptive icon displays correctly on all Android launcher shapes using emulator testing.

Purpose: Confirm the generated adaptive icons work as intended across different launcher mask shapes (round, square, squircle, teardrop) and that the foreground/background layers combine correctly with brand orange background.

Output: Verification that adaptive icons display correctly on all tested launcher shapes.

# Prerequisites
- All adaptive icon resources generated (04.4-02 complete)
- Android emulator available for testing
- App builds and installs successfully
</context>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Build and install app on Android emulator</name>
  <files>push_up_5050/android/app/buildOutputs</files>
  <action>
Build the Flutter app and install it on an Android emulator for visual verification:

1. List available emulators:
   `flutter emulators`

2. Launch an emulator (preferably one running Android 8.0+ / API 26+ for adaptive icon support):
   `flutter emulators --launch <emulator_id>`

3. Wait for emulator to fully boot (confirm with `adb devices` showing device as "device")

4. Build and install the app:
   `cd push_up_5050`
   `flutter run -d android`

5. Once app installs and launches, exit the app (back button) to return to home screen

If no emulator is available:
- Create one using Android Studio: Tools > AVD Manager > Create Virtual Device
- Or use `flutter emulators --create` if supported

DO NOT proceed with visual verification until app is successfully installed on emulator.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Emulator is running: `adb devices` shows a device
2. App is installed: App icon appears in launcher
3. App launches successfully: No crashes on startup
  </verify>
  <done>
App is installed on Android emulator and app icon is visible in launcher.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Complete adaptive icon system ready for launcher shape testing</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Test the adaptive icon on multiple launcher shapes:

1. On the emulator home screen, locate the PUSHUP 5050 app icon

2. Test different launcher shapes (method varies by Android version):
   - Long-press on empty space on home screen
   - Select "Home settings" or "Wallpapers & style"
   - Look for "Launcher icon" or "Icon shape" option
   - Try each available shape: Circle, Square, Squircle, Teardrop, etc.

3. For each shape, verify:
   - Orange background (#FF6B00) is visible
   - Foreground logo (push-up figure + 5050 text) is centered and clearly visible
   - No clipping of important logo elements
   - Icon looks balanced and professional

4. Also check the app drawer (swipe up from home screen) to see icon in list view

5. Optional: If available, test on a physical Android device with different launcher (e.g., Nova Launcher, Microsoft Launcher) for additional shape variety

Document your findings:
- Which shapes were tested?
- Any visual issues (clipping, off-center, poor contrast)?
- Overall assessment: PASS / NEEDS FIX

Type "approved" if all shapes look good, or describe specific issues.
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" or describe visual issues with specific launcher shapes</resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After human verification, document the results in the SUMMARY:
1. List of launcher shapes tested
2. PASS/FAIL status for each shape
3. Any issues identified (if applicable)
4. Overall phase completion status
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. App icon displays correctly on at least 3 different launcher shapes
2. Orange background is visible on all tested shapes
3. Foreground logo is clearly visible and centered on all tested shapes
4. No clipping or distortion of important logo elements
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/04.4-android-adaptive-icon/04.4-03-SUMMARY.md`

Include verification results documenting:
- Launcher shapes tested
- Visual quality assessment for each shape
- Any issues identified and how they were resolved (if applicable)
</output>
