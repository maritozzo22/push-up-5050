<objective>
Launch Android emulator, build debug APK, and install for testing on device.

Purpose: Verify the app runs correctly on Android hardware before proceeding with UI fixes and onboarding implementation. Early testing catches critical issues that could block later plans.

Output: Working debug APK installed on emulator, core flows verified functional.

  <action>
1. List available emulators: `flutter emulators`
2. If no emulators exist, inform user they need to create one via Android Studio AVD Manager
3. Launch an available emulator: `flutter emulators --launch <emulator_id>`
4. Wait for emulator to fully boot (check with `flutter devices` until device appears)

  <verify>`flutter devices` shows an active Android device/emulator</verify>
  <done>Emulator is running and appears in flutter devices list</done>

  <name>Task 2: Build debug APK</name>
  <files>push_up_5050/</files>
  <action>
1. Navigate to project directory: `cd push_up_5050`
2. Clean previous builds: `flutter clean`
3. Get dependencies: `flutter pub get`
4. Build debug APK: `flutter build apk --debug`

Note: Output will be at `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk`

1. With emulator running, install the APK: `flutter install`
   Alternatively: `adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk`
2. Verify installation succeeded

  <how-to-verify>
1. Locate app icon on emulator home screen (may need to swipe to app drawer)
2. Tap app icon to launch
3. Verify app opens without crash
4. Test navigation:
   - Tap START button (should open Series Selection)
   - Navigate to Statistics tab
   - Navigate to Profile tab
   - Navigate to Settings tab
5. Return to Home and verify all screens load

Report any crashes, visual issues, or navigation problems.
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if app launches and navigates correctly, or describe any issues found</resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- Emulator is running and accessible
- Debug APK exists in build outputs
- App launches without crashes
- All 4 bottom navigation tabs are accessible
- START button navigation works
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- App launches on emulator successfully
- No crashes on initial load or navigation
- All main screens (Home, Statistics, Profile, Settings) are accessible
- User confirms app is functional for testing
