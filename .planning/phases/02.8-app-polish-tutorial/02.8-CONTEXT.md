# Phase 2.8: App Polish & Tutorial - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-23
**Status:** Ready for planning

## Phase Boundary

Complete app polish work across 4 areas:
1. **Android Emulator Testing** - Launch emulator, build and install debug APK, test main flows
2. **UI Overflow Fixes** - Fix bottom overflow issues on Statistics and Workout Setup screens
3. **Onboarding Tutorial** - Create first-run experience with goal configuration (bilingual IT/EN)
4. **App Branding** - Set up app logo and icon using existing assets

---

## Implementation Decisions

### Onboarding Structure

**Page count: 3 pages**
- Page 1: Welcome + Philosophy (app illustration/hero image, title, tagline)
- Page 2: How it Works + slight app tour (icons + text list for features, tour Statistics and Workout/Series screens)
- Page 3: Goal configuration

**Navigation pattern:**
- Swipe between pages + left/right arrow buttons
- Dot indicator at bottom showing current page position
- NO skip button - onboarding is required (full gate)

**Localization:**
- Must support BOTH Italian and English versions
- User language detection based on device locale

**Welcome page layout:**
- Illustration/hero image at top
- App title and tagline below
- "Continue" button to proceed

**How It Works content:**
- Icons + text list format for each feature:
  - Progressive series counting
  - Streak tracking
  - Points system
  - Achievement system

**App tour scope:**
- Statistics page - show progress tracking
- Workout/Series page - show how to start and count reps
- Home page mentioned briefly
- Achievements and Settings not shown in tour

### Goal Configuration UX

**Daily goal input:**
- +/- buttons that increment by 1
- Long-press accelerates: faster and faster (like existing workout rep selector)
- No upper limit (unlimited range)
- Default: 50 push-ups

**Monthly goal:**
- Auto-calculated from daily (daily × 30)
- Always editable by tapping the number
- Manual override persists

**Progress preview:**
- Show dynamic time estimate: "At this pace, you'll reach 5050 in X days/months/years"
- Updates as user adjusts daily goal

**Post-onboarding goal changes:**
- Settings screen includes option to change daily/monthly goals anytime
- Same +/- button pattern for consistency

### First Launch Behavior

**Detection method:**
- SharedPreferences flag: `onboarding_completed`
- Check on app launch in main.dart

**Gate behavior:**
- Full gate - user MUST complete onboarding before accessing any app features
- No bypass, no dismissal option

**Re-show option:**
- Settings screen: "Riavvia tutorial" / "Restart tutorial" button
- Resets the `onboarding_completed` flag
- User goes through full flow again

**Persistence:**
- `onboarding_completed` flag set after completing Page 3 (goals)
- Daily and monthly goals saved to SharedPreferences
- Goals loaded by UserStatsProvider on app start

### UI Overflow Fixes

**Affected screens (user-reported):**
- Statistics screen
- Workout Setup (Series Selection) screen
- Other screens: no overflow issues reported, but verify all

**Fix approach:**
- Claude's discretion - investigate root cause of overflow on these specific screens
- Not all pages have this issue - fix only where needed
- Options: SingleChildScrollView, layout resizing, padding adjustments

**Minimum screen support:**
- 4.7 inches and up

**Testing sequence:**
- Implement all overflow fixes first
- Then test all screens together on emulator (not per-screen testing)

### App Icon & Branding

**Icon assets location:**
- `push_up_5050/Icone-App-Pushup/`

**Implementation:**
- Claude's discretion - standard Android adaptive icon configuration
- Configure Android launcher icon
- iOS icon if needed (check if project supports iOS)

---

## Specific Ideas

- Onboarding illustration should match app's dark theme with orange accents (#FF6B00)
- Goal configuration +/- buttons should feel identical to workout rep selector for consistency
- Time estimate for 5050 goal should be prominent and motivating ("You can take 1 month, 1 year, or 5 years")
- Settings screen needs two new options: "Restart tutorial" and "Change goals"

---

## Claude's Discretion

**Onboarding:**
- Exact spacing, typography, and animations between page transitions
- Dot indicator design and placement
- Illustration style (use placeholder or generate based on app theme)

**Overflow fixes:**
- Root cause investigation for Statistics and Workout Setup overflow
- Whether to use SingleChildScrollView, responsive layout, or other approach
- Exact padding/spacing adjustments

**App icons:**
- Which specific files from Icone-App-Pushup to use
- Adaptive icon configuration details
- Whether iOS icons need configuration

**Emulator testing:**
- Which AVD/image to use
- Specific test cases beyond "main flows work"

## Deferred Ideas

None - discussion stayed within phase scope.
