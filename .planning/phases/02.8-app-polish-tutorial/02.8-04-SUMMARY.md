provides:
  - Configured app launcher icons for all Android densities (mdpi through xxxhdpi)
  - Created adaptive icon with black background matching app theme
  - Generated icon foreground assets for adaptive launcher

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: flutter_launcher_icons (already existed, now used)
  patterns: automated icon generation from single source asset

key-decisions:
  - "Used existing GooglePlayStore.png (512x512) as source icon - sufficient resolution for all Android densities"
  - "Black background (#000000) for adaptive icon matches app dark theme"
  - "Adaptive icon uses same image for foreground layer to maintain brand consistency"

patterns-established:
  - "Single source icon pattern: 512x512 PNG generates all required Android densities via flutter_launcher_icons"

# Phase 2.8 Plan 04: App Launcher Icon Configuration Summary

**Generated Android launcher icons using flutter_launcher_icons with push-up branding from existing Icone-App-Pushup assets**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 7 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-23T00:25:22Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-23T00:32:30Z
- **Tasks:** 5
- **Files created:** 12
- **Files modified:** 5

## Accomplishments

- Generated standard launcher icons (ic_launcher.png) for all Android densities (mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdpi, xxxhdpi)
- Created adaptive icon configuration (mipmap-anydpi-v26/ic_launcher.xml) with black background
- Generated adaptive icon foreground assets for all densities
- Successfully built debug APK with new icons
- Verified icon assets are properly sized and visually correct

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1-3: Review and verify** - No commit (assets and configuration already existed)
2. **Task 4: Generate launcher icons** - `33e98ff` (feat)
3. **Task 5: Build and verify** - No commit (build artifacts are gitignored)

**Plan metadata:** Pending (docs commit after SUMMARY.md)

## Files Created/Modified

- `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-anydpi-v26/ic_launcher.xml` - Adaptive icon configuration with foreground/background layers
- `android/app/src/main/res/values/colors.xml` - ic_launcher_background color (#000000)
- `android/app/src/main/res/drawable-{hdpi,mdpi,xhdpi,xxhdpi,xxxhdpi}/ic_launcher_foreground.png` - Adaptive icon foregrounds (5 files)
- `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-{hdpi,mdpi,xhdpi,xxhdpi,xxxhdpi}/ic_launcher.png` - Standard launcher icons regenerated (5 files)

## Decisions Made

- **Source icon selection**: Used GooglePlayStore.png (512x512) from Icone-App-Pushup folder as it meets the recommended size for flutter_launcher_icons
- **Adaptive icon background**: Black (#000000) matches the app's dark theme
- **Foreground layer**: Uses the same icon image for consistency - the push-up figure is centered and recognizable
- **No iOS icons**: iOS generation was disabled (ios: false) in pubspec.yaml as iOS is not a priority for this phase

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

- **Silent execution**: Initial `flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons` ran without output, making it unclear if generation succeeded. Fixed by using explicit command `flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main` which produced verbose output confirming success.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- App launcher icons are now configured and ready for release builds
- Icon will display correctly on Android home screens and app drawers
- No further icon configuration needed unless rebranding is desired
