## Summary

Gap closure plan 02.8-05 successfully resolved all persistent overflow errors.

### Problem
User reported yellow/black overflow stripes on:
- Series Selection: All three workout setup cards
- Statistics: Totale Pushups card (9px), Record card (12px)

Previous fixes (SingleChildScrollView + height reductions) did NOT fully resolve the issue.

### Solution Applied

#### Series Selection Screen (`series_selection_screen.dart`):
1. Replaced `Flexible` with `Expanded` + `Center` widget for value display
2. Added `mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min` to Column
3. Reduced font sizes: 32 → 28 (value), 12 → 11 (subtitle)
4. Reduced spacing and padding throughout

#### Statistics Screen (`statistics_screen.dart`):
1. **Mini Stat Cards (_MiniStatCard)**:
   - Height: 90 → 72 → **70px** (final)
   - Padding: (10, 8) → **(6, 3)**
   - Icon: 16 → **12px**
   - Label font: 10 → **8px**
   - Value font: 22 → 18 → **16px**
   - Labels renamed: "Giorni Consecutivi" → "Streak", "Media Giornaliera" → "Media", "Miglior Giorno" → "Record"

2. **TotalPushupsCard**:
   - Height: 148 → **120px**
   - Icon: 44 → **32px**
   - Label font: 10 → **8px**
   - Value font: 18 → **13px**

3. **CalorieCard**:
   - Height: 148 → **120px** (to match TotalPushupsCard)
   - Same font/size reductions

### Screenshots for Verification

**Series Selection:** Clean layout, no overflow stripes
**Statistics (screen_stats_v3.png):** All cards fit properly, no overflow
