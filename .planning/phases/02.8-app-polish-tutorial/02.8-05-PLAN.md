<objective>
Fix persistent bottom overflow errors reported by user on Series Selection and Statistics screens.

User confirmed: "bottom overflowed by 17 pixels" on all 3 buttons in workout setup (Series Selection) and Statistics page.

Previous fixes (SingleChildScrollView + reduced heights 140→120, 160→135) did NOT resolve the issue.

Purpose: Eliminate overflow indicators completely to ensure app is usable on all screen sizes.

User provided screenshot showing yellow/black overflow stripes on cards.

Current card heights (still causing overflow):
- Series Selection: 120, 135, 135 (needs further reduction)
- Statistics: Mini stat cards (GIORNI CONSECUTIVI, MEDIA GIORNALIERA, MIGLIOR GIORNO)

  <name>Task 1: Further reduce Series Selection card heights</name>
  <files>push_up_5050/lib/screens/series_selection/series_selection_screen.dart</files>
  <action>
Current heights (120, 135, 135) still cause overflow. Reduce further:

1. Starting Series card: 120 → 100px
2. Rest Time card: 135 → 110px
3. Goal Push-ups card: 135 → 110px

Total reduction: 50px additional (120px total from original).

Also reduce spacing between cards:
- Change spacing from SizedBox(height: 18) to SizedBox(height: 12)
  </action>
  <verify>Card heights updated to 100, 110, 110 with reduced spacing</verify>
  <done>Series Selection cards more compact</done>

  <name>Task 2: Fix Statistics Mini Stat Cards overflow</name>
  <files>push_up_5050/lib/screens/statistics/statistics_screen.dart</files>
  <action>
The user reported overflow on "GIORNI CONSECUTIVI", "MEDIA GIORNALIERA", "MIGLIOR GIORNO" cards.

Find the _MiniStatCard widget implementation and reduce:
1. Card height or internal padding
2. Font size if necessary
3. Icon size if necessary

The cards are in a Row at lines ~139-166. They may have fixed height causing overflow.

If the widget is defined elsewhere, find and modify it.
  </action>
  <verify>_MiniStatCard height reduced or made flexible</verify>
  <done>Statistics mini cards fit without overflow</done>

  <name>Task 3: Reduce vertical spacing in Series Selection</name>
  <files>push_up_5050/lib/screens/series_selection/series_selection_screen.dart</files>
  <action>
Reduce vertical spacing throughout Series Selection screen:

1. Top spacing: SizedBox(height: 18) → SizedBox(height: 12)
2. After title: SizedBox(height: 34) → SizedBox(height: 20)
3. Between cards: Change all SizedBox(height: 18) → SizedBox(height: 12)
4. Before button: SizedBox(height: 24) → SizedBox(height: 16)

This saves ~40px of vertical space.
  </action>
  <verify>All vertical spacing reduced appropriately</verify>
  <done>More compact layout</done>

  <how-to-verify>
1. Launch app on emulator
2. Navigate to Series Selection (tap START)
3. Verify NO yellow/black overflow stripes on:
   - Starting Series card
   - Rest Time card
   - Goal Push-ups card
   - BEGIN WORKOUT button area
4. Navigate to Statistics tab
5. Verify NO overflow on:
   - GIORNI CONSECUTIVI card
   - MEDIA GIORNALIERA card
   - MIGLIOR GIORNO card
   - Calendar area

If overflow still appears:
- Take a screenshot showing the overflow
- Note which specific card/area has the issue
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if NO overflow visible, or provide screenshot of remaining issue</resume-signal>
