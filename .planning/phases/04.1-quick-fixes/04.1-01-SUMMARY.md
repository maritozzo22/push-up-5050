# Phase 04.1: Plan 01 Summary

**Default recovery time changed from 30 to 10 seconds in SeriesSelectionScreen**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 5 min (329 seconds)
- **Started:** 2026-01-29T12:59:04Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-29T13:04:13Z
- **Tasks:** 1
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments

- Changed `_restTime` default from 30 to 10 seconds in `SeriesSelectionScreen`
- Updated all test expectations to match new default value
- Verified all tests pass (unit + widget tests)

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Update default recovery time to 10 seconds** - `5f93d06` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** (pending)

## Files Created/Modified

- `push_up_5050/lib/screens/series_selection/series_selection_screen.dart` - Changed line 41: `int _restTime = 10;` (was 30)
- `push_up_5050/test/screens/series_selection/series_selection_screen_test.dart` - Updated 7 test expectations from 30 to 10

## Decisions Made

- New users will now see 10 seconds as the default recovery time (previously 30)
- Existing users with saved preferences (e.g., 30, 45, 60) retain their values
- The change aligns with the "faster workouts" goal for v2.6 milestone
