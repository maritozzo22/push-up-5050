# Phase 04.1: Quick Fixes - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-29
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Update the default recovery time from 30 to 10 seconds. This is a simple configuration change that affects the default value shown in series selection. NOT in scope: changing recovery time logic, user adjustment range (5-120s), or persistence mechanism.

## Implementation Decisions

### New vs Existing Users
- **Default change only**: Update the default constant from 30 to 10 seconds
- **No migration logic**: Existing user values remain unchanged
- **Silent change**: No notification or announcement to existing users
- **New installs only**: 10 seconds applies to new installations; existing users keep their configured value

### UI Display
- **No UI changes**: Series selection screen remains exactly as-is
- **10s as default**: Simply the pre-selected option in recovery time picker
- **User adjustment**: Users can still increase/decrease as before (5-120s range)

### Validation Scope
- **Unit test only**: Verify constant value equals 10 seconds
- **No range testing**: 5-120s logic already works, no need to re-test
- **No integration test**: Full workout flow not needed for this change

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact file location of the default constant
- Test file organization and naming
