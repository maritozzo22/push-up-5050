| 2 | Popup displays Italian message: "Complimenti! Hai completato il tuo obiettivo di oggi. Ci vediamo domani!" | VERIFIED | goal_completion_dialog.dart lines 131, 143 - exact Italian text as specified |
| 3 | Popup includes button to return to appropriate screen | VERIFIED | "Continua" button present (line 166), navigates to Statistics after goal reached (line 288), stays on Home for app-open (line 182) |
| 4 | Popup appears when app opens after goal was completed earlier | VERIFIED | home_screen.dart lines 68, 168-183 - _checkAndShowGoalCompletion() called in initState |
| 5 | No partial progress achievement popups (only goal completion) | VERIFIED | shouldShowGoalCompletionPopup() checks totalPushups >= dailyGoal (storage_service.dart line 843) - only triggers on full goal completion |
