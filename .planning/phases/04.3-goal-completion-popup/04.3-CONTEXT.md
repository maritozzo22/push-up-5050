# Phase 04.3: Goal Completion Popup - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-30
**Status:** Ready for planning

## Phase Boundary

Congratulations popup that appears when daily push-up goal is reached. Popup triggers immediately upon goal completion during workout, and once when app opens if goal was already completed today. No partial-progress popups — only full goal completion celebration.

## Implementation Decisions

### Visual design
- Dialog style: Small centered dialog with dimmed background (not full-screen or bottom sheet)
- Entry animation: Scale + fade (zoom-in effect for attention-grabbing)
- Visual elements: Confetti/effects (celebration feel, not trophy icon)
- Color scheme: Primary orange theme (#FF6B00) with celebration accents

### Dismissal behavior
- User can dismiss by tapping outside dialog OR clicking the button
- Short timeout of 5 seconds, then auto-dismisses
- Button text: "Continua" (Italian, user confirmed acceptable)
- Either tap-outside OR button click works for dismissal

### Trigger timing (during workout)
- Popup appears immediately when last series completes the daily goal
- After popup is dismissed (button or timeout), auto-navigate to statistics screen
- Use short transition delay (~500ms) for smooth UX
- User clarified: "Quando in automatico finisce la sessione dopo l'ultima serie...gli esce il popup e poi va sulla schermata statistiche"

### App-open behavior
- Show popup once per day when app opens (if goal already completed today)
- Track "shown today" flag to prevent re-showing
- Stay on current screen — popup is overlay only, no navigation after app-open popup
- Reset tracking at midnight

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact implementation of "shown today" tracking flag (SharedPreferences vs DailyRecord integration)
- Confetti animation library or custom implementation
- Exact popup dimensions and spacing within dialog style
- Transition animation timing between popup dismissal and statistics navigation

## Specific Ideas

- Confetti/effects for celebration feel (not trophy icon)
- Italian button text: "Continua"
- 5-second timeout feels right for celebration moment
- User wants statistics screen after goal completion, not Home screen

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope.
