# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 04.3-goal-completion-popup
    provides: complete app feature set with goal completion flow
provides:
  - Android adaptive icon foreground layer with transparent background
  - pubspec.yaml configuration for adaptive icon with #FF6B00 background color
  - Foundation for launcher icon safe zone testing (next plan)
affects: 04.4-02

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: flutter_launcher_icons package for adaptive icon generation
  patterns: Android adaptive icon specification with foreground + background color

  created:

    - push_up_5050/assets/launcher/icon_foreground.svg
  modified:
    - push_up_5050/pubspec.yaml

key-decisions:
  - "Used ImageMagick for foreground layer extraction with transparent background"
  - "Applied adaptive icon safe zone (66% diameter) to foreground layer"
  - "Configured #FF6B00 (app primary orange) as adaptive icon background color"

patterns-established:
  - "Adaptive icon pattern: foreground layer on solid background color for launcher shape adaptation"

# Phase 04.4 Plan 01: Foreground Asset Extraction Summary

**Adaptive icon foreground layer extracted from original launcher icon with transparent background, configured with #FF6B00 background color in pubspec.yaml**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~15 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-30
- **Completed:** 2026-01-30
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments

- Extracted clean foreground layer from original launcher icon using ImageMagick with transparent background
- Created SVG version of foreground asset for scalability
- Configured flutter_launcher_icons in pubspec.yaml with adaptive icon specification

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Extract foreground layer** - `e0a3a84` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Update pubspec.yaml config** - `6f09bb4` (feat)
3. **Task 3: flutter pub get verification** - completed successfully

**Plan metadata:** [pending]

## Files Created/Modified

- `push_up_5050/assets/launcher/icon_foreground.png` - Foreground layer with transparent background (1024x1024)
- `push_up_5050/assets/launcher/icon_foreground.svg` - SVG version for scalability
- `push_up_5050/pubspec.yaml` - Added flutter_launcher_icons configuration with adaptive icon spec

## Decisions Made

- Used ImageMagick for transparent background extraction (standard tool available in environment)
- Applied 66% diameter safe zone to ensure foreground content fits within adaptive icon safe area
- Configured #FF6B00 (primary brand orange) as background color for brand consistency

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Ready for next plan (04.4-02: Verify Icon Safe Zones) which will test the adaptive icon on physical device
- Physical device testing required to verify foreground layer displays correctly across various launcher shapes
