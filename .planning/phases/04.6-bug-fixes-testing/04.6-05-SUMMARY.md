# Plan 04.6-05: Chrome/Web Testing - SUMMARY

**Status:** COMPLETE ✓
**Duration:** 15 minutes
**Date:** 2026-01-30

## Objective

Test all bug fixes from Phase 04.6 via Chrome/web platform to validate they work correctly before merging to main branch.

## What Was Built

### Verification Results

All four bug fixes were verified working correctly:

**BUG-01: Onboarding Daily Goal Display** ✅ PASS
- Home screen "OGGI" card displays personalized daily goal
- Verified: Shows "0/20" (not hardcoded "0/50")
- `GoalsProvider.dailyGoal.target` correctly provides personalized value
- Progress bar calculates correctly: `(todayPushups / dailyGoal).clamp(0.0, 1.0)`

**BUG-02: Series Selection Cap** ✅ PASS
- Series selection correctly capped at `dailyGoal + 10`
- Verified: After 35 + clicks, max value = 30 (goal 20 + 10)
- `_getMaxStartingSeries()` calculates `(dailyGoal + 10).clamp(10, 99)`
- Hardcoded 99 limit removed

**BUG-03: Goal Completion Navigation** ✅ PASS
- Code verification confirmed: `_handleGoalCompletion()` calls `_navigateToWorkoutSummary()`
- No `/statistics` route in goal completion path
- Shared method handles both normal workout end and goal completion
- Session data captured before `endWorkout()` (session becomes null after)

**BUG-04: Calorie Card UI** ✅ PASS
- Calorie Card displays cleanly without decorative gradient bar
- Layout matches other stat cards (icon, label, value only)
- `Spacer()` and gradient bar `Container` removed
- Replaced with simple `SizedBox(height: 8)` for spacing

### Testing Method

1. Launched Flutter web app via `flutter run -d chrome`
2. Completed onboarding flow (selected activity level, daily goal = 20)
3. Verified Home screen displays personalized "0/20" (not "0/50")
4. Navigated to Series Selection, tested + button 35 times - confirmed cap at 30
5. Navigated to Statistics, verified Calorie Card has no gradient bar

### Screenshots Captured

- `home_final.png` - Home screen showing "0/20" personalized goal
- `series_max.png` - Series selection showing max 30 (capped at goal+10)
- `statistics.png` - Statistics screen showing clean Calorie Card

## Files Modified

No code changes in this plan - verification only.

## Technical Notes

**Flutter Web Testing:**
- Web platform uses canvas-based rendering (not DOM accessibility friendly)
- Some hardware features unavailable (haptics, proximity sensor)
- UI rendering and state flow work correctly on web
- Chrome DevTools showed no console errors

**Verification Approach:**
- Code inspection for navigation fixes (BUG-03)
- Visual testing via Playwright for UI fixes (BUG-01, BUG-02, BUG-04)
- Interactive testing via button clicks for cap verification

## Success Criteria

- [x] BUG-01: Personalized daily goal displays on Home screen
- [x] BUG-02: Series selection cap enforced at daily goal + 10
- [x] BUG-03: Goal completion navigates to Workout Summary (code verified)
- [x] BUG-04: Calorie card displays without gradient bar
- [x] User approves verification

## Next Steps

Phase 04.6 is now complete. Proceed to:
1. Update ROADMAP.md with phase completion
2. Update STATE.md with final position
3. Commit phase completion
4. Verify phase goal achievement
5. Offer next phase options
