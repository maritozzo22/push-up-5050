<objective>
Test all bug fixes from Phase 04.6 via Chrome/web platform.

This plan verifies that all four bug fixes (04.6-01 through 04.6-04) work correctly when run on the web platform. Web testing provides quick visual verification without requiring physical device setup.

Purpose: Validate bug fixes work correctly before merging to main branch.
Output: Verification report confirming all fixes functional.

  <name>Task 1: Launch app on Chrome and verify build</name>
  <files>push_up_5050/</files>
  <action>
    1. Navigate to push_up_5050 directory:
       `cd "C:\Script\Android-Apps\Push-up flutter Nuovo test\push_up_5050"`

    2. Ensure dependencies are installed:
       `flutter pub get`

    3. Run app on Chrome:
       `flutter run -d chrome`

    4. Wait for app to fully load (Home screen visible)

    5. Verify no console errors in Chrome DevTools

    NOTE: Web platform lacks some hardware features (haptics, proximity sensor) but UI rendering and state flow should work.

  <how-to-verify>
    In the Chrome browser with the app running, verify each fix:

    **BUG-01: Onboarding Goal Display**
    1. Check Home screen "OGGI" stat card
    2. Verify it shows personalized goal (e.g., "0/20" not "0/50")
    3. Progress bar should fill based on personalized goal

    **BUG-02: Series Selection Cap**
    1. Tap START button to go to Series Selection
    2. Try to increment starting series using + button
    3. Verify you cannot exceed (daily goal + 10)
    4. For goal=20, max should be 30; for goal=50, max should be 60

    **BUG-03: Goal Completion Navigation**
    1. Note: Full flow requires completing workout (may be time-consuming in web)
    2. Verify code inspection shows _handleGoalCompletion calls _navigateToWorkoutSummary
    3. Check that no `/statistics` route exists in goal completion path

    **BUG-04: Calorie Card Display**
    1. Navigate to Statistics screen (tap Stats icon)
    2. Find "CALORIE BRUCIATE" card
    3. Verify NO gradient bar at bottom (should match other cards)
    4. Card should have clean layout with icon, label, value only

    Expected results:
    - Home screen shows personalized daily goal
    - Series selection respects cap limit
    - Calorie card has no decorative bar
    - Navigation code points to WorkoutSummaryScreen
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if all fixes verified, or describe any issues found.</resume-signal>
