## Files Created/Modified

### Created

- `push_up_5050/lib/screens/onboarding/widgets/frequency_selector.dart` (223 lines)
  - StatelessWidget for workout frequency selection (1-7 days per week)
  - Circular +/- buttons with enable/disable states
  - Frost card container matching app design
  - Uses `_CircleIconButton` with gradient styling from SeriesSelectionScreen

- `push_up_5050/lib/screens/onboarding/widgets/daily_goal_slider.dart` (220 lines)
  - StatelessWidget for daily goal selection with slider
  - Preset values [20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 75, 100] mapped to 7 slider positions
  - Progress preview showing estimated time to reach 5050
  - Slider with orange accent matching app theme

### Modified

- `push_up_5050/lib/l10n/app_en.arb`
  - Added `onboardingFrequencyTitle`: "Workout Frequency"
  - Added `onboardingFrequencyDesc`: "How many days per week do you plan to work out?"
  - Added `onboardingDaysPerWeek`: "days per week"
  - Added `onboardingDailyGoalSliderTitle`: "Daily Goal"
  - Added `onboardingDailyGoalSliderDesc`: "Set a realistic daily target..."
  - Added `onboardingPushupsPerDay`: "push-ups per day"
  - Added `onboardingPacePreview`: "At this pace, you'll reach 5050 in about {time}"

- `push_up_5050/lib/l10n/app_it.arb`
  - Added Italian translations for all keys above
  - `onboardingFrequencyTitle`: "Frequenza degli Allenamenti"
  - `onboardingDaysPerWeek`: "giorni a settimana"
  - etc.

## Decisions Made

1. **Simple counter for frequency** - Used 1-7 counter instead of day toggle (M T W T F S S) for cleaner, more intuitive UX
2. **Preset slider values** - Limited to 7 discrete values rather than free-form input to guide users toward realistic goals
3. **Progress preview calculation** - Shows months/years to reach 5050 based on selected daily goal, helping users set expectations

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None - all widgets compiled successfully and flutter analyze passed with no errors.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- **Ready for:** Plan 03.1-03 (Main Onboarding Flow Integration)
- **What's ready:**
  - FrequencySelector widget accepts `value` and `ValueChanged<int>` callback
  - DailyGoalSlider widget accepts `value` and `ValueChanged<int>` callback
  - Both widgets follow consistent design patterns (frost card, circular buttons)
  - All i18n keys available in EN and IT

- **Blockers:** None
