# Phase 03.1: Personalized Onboarding - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-23
**Status:** Ready for planning

## Phase Boundary

First-launch experience that collects user fitness data (activity level, max push-up capacity, workout frequency, daily goal) and generates personalized workout recommendations. The 4 answers determine starting series, daily goal, and recovery time. Onboarding is mandatory and cannot be skipped.

## Implementation Decisions

### Screen flow & navigation
- Back navigation allowed — users can go back and change previous answers
- Progress shown as dot indicators (4 dots, current position highlighted)
- No skip button — onboarding is mandatory, users must complete to use the app
- After 4th screen: Claude's discretion (summary vs. direct to home)

### Question input methods
- **Activity level**: Card selection with icons (Sedentary, Lightly Active, Active, Very Active)
- **Max capacity**: Slider with preset values (5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
- **Frequency**: Claude's discretion (day buttons or frequency chips)
- **Daily goal**: Slider with presets (20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 75, 100)

### Recommendations display
- No dedicated recommendations screen — values applied silently
- Success message: "Based on your answers, we've customized your plan" (or similar hint)
- Users discover their personalized values through app usage

### Skip & defaults (IMPORTANT: Anti-cheat)
- **No skip button** — onboarding is mandatory
- **No Settings editing** — users CANNOT change recommendations after onboarding (anti-cheat: prevents gaming points system)
- If user force-closes and returns: show incomplete onboarding from start
- Replace existing onboarding (already in codebase) with new 4-screen flow

### Claude's Discretion
- Final screen behavior (summary screen vs. direct navigation to home)
- Workout frequency input method (day buttons 1-7, or frequency chips)
- Exact wording of success message (convey personalization without revealing algorithm)

## Specific Ideas

- Dot indicators for progress (similar to many modern onboarding flows)
- Card selection for activity level with visual icons
- Slider-based inputs for numeric values (capacity, goal)
- Success message should hint at personalization but not explain details

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope.
