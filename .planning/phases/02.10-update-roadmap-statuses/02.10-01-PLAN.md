# Phase 02.10-01: Update ROADMAP.md Phase Statuses

**Created:** 2026-01-23
**Status:** PLANNED
**Wave:** 1 (single autonomous plan)

## Goal

Update ROADMAP.md to reflect the actual completion state of phases 02.6, 02.7, 02.8, and 02.9.

## Context

The ROADMAP.md shows outdated status information:
- Phase 02.6: Shows "NOT STARTED" but was actually executed
- Phase 02.7: Shows "NOT STARTED" but was actually executed
- Phase 02.8: Shows "IN PROGRESS" but is COMPLETE (all 5 plans verified)
- Phase 02.9: Shows "PLANNED" but is COMPLETE

## Tasks

1. **Update Phase 02.6 Status**
   - Determine actual completion state from 02.6-*-SUMMARY.md files
   - Update ROADMAP.md status emoji (✅ for complete, 🔄 for in progress)
   - Mark all plan checkboxes as complete

2. **Update Phase 02.7 Status**
   - Determine actual completion state from 02.7-*-SUMMARY.md files
   - Update ROADMAP.md status emoji
   - Mark all plan checkboxes as complete

3. **Update Phase 02.8 Status**
   - Set status to ✅ COMPLETE
   - Mark all 5 plans (02.8-01 through 02.8-05) as complete
   - Update VERIFICATION.md reference

4. **Update Phase 02.9 Status**
   - Set status to ✅ COMPLETE (from PLANNED)
   - Mark plan 02.9-01 as complete
   - Add SUMMARY.md reference

5. **Update Last Updated Date**
   - Change `*Last updated: 2026-01-22*` to current date

## Execution Steps

1. Read existing SUMMARY.md files to determine actual completion state
2. Update ROADMAP.md phase statuses
3. Verify all changes are consistent with STATE.md

## Deliverables
