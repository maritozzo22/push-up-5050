# Phase 02.10-01: Update ROADMAP.md Phase Statuses

**Created:** 2026-01-23
**Status:** PLANNED
**Wave:** 1 (single autonomous plan)

## Goal

Update ROADMAP.md to reflect the actual completion state of phases 02.6, 02.7, 02.8, and 02.9 based on STATE.md as the source of truth.

## Context

The ROADMAP.md shows outdated status information:
- Phase 02.6: Shows "NOT STARTED" but actually has 4/5 plans complete (per STATE.md)
- Phase 02.7: Shows "IN PROGRESS" but plan count is wrong (shows 4 plans, STATE.md shows 3 complete)
- Phase 02.8: Shows "GAPS FOUND" but is COMPLETE (all plans executed, VERIFICATION.md exists)
- Phase 02.9: Shows "PLANNED" but is COMPLETE (SUMMARY.md exists)

**Important:** Phases 02.6 and 02.7 do NOT have formal phase directories with SUMMARY.md files. The work was documented in STATE.md instead. Use STATE.md as the source of truth for these phases.

**Actual project state (from STATE.md):**

**Phase 02.6:** IN PROGRESS (4/5 plans complete)
- 02.6-01: Create Calendar Service for Widget Data ✅
- 02.6-02: Integrate Calendar Service with Widget Updates ✅
- 02.6-03: Update Android Widget Providers with Calendar Rendering ✅
- 02.6-04: WorkManager Midnight Update for Calendar Refresh ✅
- 02.6-05: Widget Testing & Verification ❌ (never executed)

**Phase 02.7:** IN PROGRESS (3/4 plans complete)
- 02.7-01: Widget Drawable Resources ✅
- 02.7-02: Widget Layouts ✅
- 02.7-03: Widget Provider Implementation ✅
- 02.7-04: Build, deploy, and verify widgets on device ❌ (never executed)

**Phase 02.8:** COMPLETE
- All 5 plans complete, VERIFICATION.md exists

**Phase 02.9:** COMPLETE
- 02.9-01: Goals Persistence Integration ✅
- SUMMARY.md exists

## Tasks

1. **Update Phase 02.6 Status**
   - Read STATE.md to determine actual completion state (4/5 plans complete)
   - Update ROADMAP.md status to 🔄 IN PROGRESS (from "NOT STARTED")
   - Mark completed plans (02.6-01 through 02.6-04) with [x]
   - Leave 02.6-05 unchecked

2. **Update Phase 02.7 Status**
   - Read STATE.md to determine actual completion state (3/4 plans complete)
   - Keep ROADMAP.md status as 🔄 IN PROGRESS (already correct)
   - Mark completed plans (02.7-01 through 02.7-03) with [x]
   - Leave 02.7-04 unchecked

3. **Update Phase 02.8 Status**
   - Set status to ✅ COMPLETE (from "GAPS FOUND")
   - Mark all 5 plans (02.8-01 through 02.8-05) as complete
   - Update VERIFICATION.md reference

4. **Update Phase 02.9 Status**
   - Set status to ✅ COMPLETE (from "PLANNED")
   - Mark plan 02.9-01 as complete
   - Add SUMMARY.md reference

5. **Decision: Handle Unexecuted Plans in ROADMAP**
   - Determine whether to:
     - Option A: Remove unexecuted plans (02.6-05, 02.7-04) from ROADMAP lists
     - Option B: Keep plans but mark phases as IN PROGRESS with accurate checkboxes
   - Document decision in STATE.md under "Decisions Made" section

6. **Update Last Updated Date**
   - Change `*Last updated: 2026-01-22*` to current date

## Execution Steps

1. Read STATE.md to determine actual completion state for all phases
2. Update ROADMAP.md phase statuses based on STATE.md entries
3. Make decision about unexecuted plans (remove vs keep as incomplete)
4. Update ROADMAP.md checkboxes to reflect actual completion
5. Update last updated date
6. Verify all changes are consistent with STATE.md

## Deliverables

- ROADMAP.md with accurate phase statuses
- All phase statuses reflect actual completion state from STATE.md
- Decision documented about handling unexecuted plans

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Phase 02.6 status shows IN PROGRESS (4/5 complete), based on STATE.md
- [ ] Phase 02.7 status shows IN PROGRESS (3/4 complete), based on STATE.md
- [ ] Phase 02.8 status shows COMPLETE with all 5 plans checked
- [ ] Phase 02.9 status shows COMPLETE (not PLANNED)
- [ ] Unexecuted plan checkboxes are correctly unchecked
- [ ] Last updated date is current
- [ ] Decision about unexecuted plans is documented

## Dependencies

None - this is a documentation-only phase

## Success Criteria

- ROADMAP.md accurately reflects project state from STATE.md
- No discrepancies between ROADMAP.md and STATE.md completion status
- Clear documentation of how unexecuted plans should be handled
