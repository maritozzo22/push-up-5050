# Phase 02.10: Update ROADMAP.md Phase Statuses Summary

**ROADMAP.md synchronized with actual project state from STATE.md source of truth**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 8 minutes
- **Started:** 2026-01-23T13:23:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-23T13:31:00Z

- Phase 02.8 status changed from GAPS FOUND to COMPLETE (all 5 plans verified)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Update Phase 02.6 status to IN PROGRESS (4/5 complete)** - `015166d` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Update Phase 02.7 status to IN PROGRESS (3/4 complete)** - `a01dcfb` (feat)

6. **Task 6: Update ROADMAP.md last updated date to 2026-01-23** - `3f5e958` (docs)

## Files Created/Modified

- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` - Updated phase statuses for 02.6, 02.7, 02.8, 02.9; added VERIFICATION.md reference for 02.8; added SUMMARY.md reference for 02.9; updated last updated date
- `.planning/STATE.md` - Added decision documentation for unexecuted plans handling
- `.planning/phases/02.10-update-roadmap-statuses/02.10-01-SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Decisions Made

### Unexecuted Plans Handling
- **Decision:** Keep unexecuted plans (02.6-05, 02.7-04) as PENDING in ROADMAP.md rather than removing them
- **Rationale:** Provides transparency about what was originally planned vs what was completed. Removing plans would hide the gap and create false impression of complete execution.
- **Alternative considered:** Remove unexecuted plans from ROADMAP (rejected for transparency reasons)

### Source of Truth
- **Decision:** STATE.md is the authoritative source for phase completion status
- **Rationale:** Some phases (02.6, 02.7) don't have formal SUMMARY.md files but are documented in STATE.md Recent Activity section
- **Pattern:** ROADMAP.md is a derived artifact that should be synchronized with STATE.md

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written. All 6 tasks completed as specified.

## Issues Encountered

None - documentation-only phase with straightforward edits.

## Authentication Gates

None - no external services or authentication required.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- ROADMAP.md now accurately reflects project state
- Phases 02.8 and 02.9 are COMPLETE and can be closed
- Phases 02.6 and 02.7 remain IN PROGRESS with one pending plan each
- Phase 02.11 (cleanup) can proceed if needed
