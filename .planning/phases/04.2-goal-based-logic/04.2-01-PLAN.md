<objective>
Goal Completion Detection During Workout

Purpose: Detect when daily goal is reached during active workout session, accounting for cumulative progress across all sessions today
Output: Modified ActiveWorkoutProvider with goal completion check after each rep

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add goal completion check method to ActiveWorkoutProvider</name>
  <files>push_up_5050/lib/providers/active_workout_provider.dart</files>
  <action>
Add a new private method `_checkGoalCompletion()` that:

1. Gets today's date using DateTime.now()
2. Fetches existing daily record via `_storage.getDailyRecord(today)`
3. Calculates todayReps from existing record (or 0 if none)
4. Adds current session's totalReps to get cumulative total
5. Gets daily goal from `_storage.getDailyGoal()`
6. If cumulative >= goal: sets `session.goalReached = true`

Implementation details:
- Use async/await for storage calls
- Handle null session gracefully (early return)
- Handle null goalPushups gracefully (no goal = no check)
- The method should be private (underscore prefix)

Location: Add after `_calculateRepPoints()` method, before `advanceToNextSeries()`
</action>
  <verify>
grep -n "_checkGoalCompletion" push_up_5050/lib/providers/active_workout_provider.dart
flutter test test/providers/active_workout_provider_test.dart 2>&1 || echo "Test file may not exist yet"
</verify>
  <done>
_checkGoalCompletion() method exists and:
- Fetches today's record from storage
- Calculates cumulative progress (existing + session)
- Compares to daily goal
- Sets goalReached flag when threshold met
</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Call goal completion check in countRep()</name>
  <files>push_up_5050/lib/providers/active_workout_provider.dart</files>
  <action>
Modify the `countRep()` method to call `_checkGoalCompletion()` after incrementing reps.

Find the existing countRep() method (around line 161) and add:
```dart
// Check for goal completion after counting rep
await _checkGoalCompletion();
```

This should be added AFTER `_session!.countRep()` but BEFORE `_saveSession()`.

Important: The countRep() method is already async, so no signature change needed.
</action>
  <verify>
grep -A 5 "void countRep()" push_up_5050/lib/providers/active_workout_provider.dart | grep "_checkGoalCompletion"
</verify>
  <done>
countRep() now calls _checkGoalCompletion() after each rep, enabling real-time goal detection during workout.
</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Add helper method to check if today's goal is already complete</name>
  <files>push_up_5050/lib/providers/active_workout_provider.dart</files>
  <action>
Add a new public getter `isDailyGoalComplete` that returns true if today's goal is already reached BEFORE starting a workout.

This is needed by HomeScreen to disable the start button when goal is complete.

Implementation:
```dart
/// Check if today's daily goal has already been completed.
///
/// Returns true if today's existing record totalPushups >= daily goal.
/// Used by HomeScreen to disable start button when goal complete.
Future<bool> isDailyGoalComplete() async {
  final today = DateTime.now();
  final existingRecord = await _storage.getDailyRecord(today);
  final todayReps = existingRecord?.totalPushups ?? 0;
  final goal = _storage.getDailyGoal();
  return todayReps >= goal;
}
```

Add this getter after the `sessionPoints` getter (around line 72).
</action>
  <verify>
grep -n "isDailyGoalComplete" push_up_5050/lib/providers/active_workout_provider.dart
</verify>
  <done>
isDailyGoalComplete getter exists and returns true when today's existing reps >= daily goal.
</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. Review ActiveWorkoutProvider code to ensure _checkGoalCompletion() exists
2. Verify countRep() calls _checkGoalCompletion() after each rep
3. Verify isDailyGoalComplete getter is accessible from HomeScreen
4. Run: flutter analyze lib/providers/active_workout_provider.dart
5. Run: flutter test test/providers/ 2>&1 || echo "Tests may need to be created"
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. Goal completion check runs after every rep during workout
2. Check accounts for cumulative progress (existing today reps + session reps)
3. session.goalReached flag is set when goal threshold is met
4. isDailyGoalComplete getter available for UI consumption
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/04.2-goal-based-logic/04.2-01-SUMMARY.md`
