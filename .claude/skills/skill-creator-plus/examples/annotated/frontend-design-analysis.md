## Full Skill with Annotations

```markdown
---
name: frontend-design
description: Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high
  design quality. Use this skill when the user asks to build web components,
  pages, or applications. Generates creative, polished code that avoids generic
  AI aesthetics.
---
```

### ✅ **Strong Description**
- **Specific**: "web components, pages, or applications"
- **Value prop**: "distinctive, production-grade... avoids generic AI aesthetics"
- **Clear trigger**: "when the user asks to build..."
- **Sets expectations**: "creative, polished code"

---

```markdown
This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces
that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with
exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.
```

### ✅ **Immediate Problem Framing**
- Identifies the problem ("AI slop aesthetics")
- States the solution (distinctive, production-grade)
- Sets tone (exceptional attention to details)

---

```markdown
The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or
interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or
technical constraints.
```

### ✅ **Input Clarification**
- Defines what inputs to expect
- Acknowledges variability in requirements
- Prepares for different levels of specification

---

```markdown
## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
```

### ✅ **Philosophy Section First**
- **Not** "Step 1: Write code"
- **Instead**: "Before coding, think about..."
- Establishes mental framework before execution

---

```markdown
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic,
  organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine,
  brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc.
  There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design
  one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone
  will remember?
```

### ✅ **Pre-Action Questions (Philosophy Pattern 1)**
- Four key questions establish thinking framework
- **Purpose**: Grounds in user needs
- **Tone**: Forces aesthetic commitment with concrete examples
- **Constraints**: Acknowledges real-world limitations
- **Differentiation**: Pushes for memorable outcomes

### ✅ **Inspiring Examples**
- "brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic..."
- Provides vocabulary and possibilities
- "Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction"
  - Prevents template copying

---

```markdown
**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision.
Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality,
not intensity.
```

### ✅ **Intentionality Over Intensity (Philosophy Pattern 5)**
- Validates multiple approaches (minimalism AND maximalism)
- Focuses on quality of thinking ("intentionality")
- Removes pressure to be "extreme"
- Key insight: execution matters more than approach choice

---

```markdown
Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail
```

### ✅ **Quality Standards**
- Four clear criteria for success
- Balances function ("production-grade") and form ("visually striking")
- Emphasizes coherence ("clear aesthetic point-of-view")
- Sets high bar ("meticulously refined")

---

```markdown
## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:
```

### ✅ **Organized by Category**
- Clear section structure
- "Guidelines" not "Rules" (more flexible)
- "Focus on" implies priority areas

---

```markdown
- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting.
  Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices
  that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices.
  Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
```

### ✅ **Specific Actionable + Anti-Pattern**
- **Positive**: "distinctive choices that elevate aesthetics"
- **Negative**: "Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter"
- **Concrete pattern**: "Pair distinctive display font with refined body font"
- Names specific bad examples (Arial, Inter)

---

```markdown
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for
  consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid,
  evenly-distributed palettes.
```

### ✅ **Principle + Technical Guidance**
- "Commit to cohesive aesthetic" (principle)
- "Use CSS variables" (technical implementation)
- "Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform..." (opinionated guidance based on what works)

---

```markdown
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize
  CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available.
  Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered
  reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions.
  Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.
```

### ✅ **Technical Specificity**
- Names specific tools (Motion library)
- Provides strategic guidance ("high-impact moments" over "scattered")
- Concrete technique ("staggered reveals with animation-delay")
- Encourages surprise and delight

---

```markdown
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow.
  Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.
```

### ✅ **Terse, Evocative Language**
- Short, punchy phrases create energy
- "OR" acknowledges multiple valid approaches
- Pushes beyond conventional (grid-breaking, diagonal flow)

---

```markdown
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than
  defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match
  the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise
  textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows,
  decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.
```

### ✅ **Toolkit Provision**
- "rather than defaulting to solid colors" (anti-pattern)
- Lists specific techniques (gradient meshes, noise textures...)
- "that match the overall aesthetic" (context-awareness)
- Expands creative vocabulary

---

```markdown
NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter,
Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple
gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns,
and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.
```

### ✅ **Strong Anti-Pattern Section**
- Uses "NEVER" (emphatic)
- Names specific bad patterns (Inter, Roboto, purple gradients)
- Identifies problem ("cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character")

This is critical - tells Claude explicitly what NOT to do.

---

```markdown
Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed
for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark
themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices
(Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.
```

### ✅ **Variation Encouragement (Pattern 1 + 2)**
- "No design should be the same" (explicit variation instruction)
- "NEVER converge on common choices" (anti-convergence warning)
- Names specific example (Space Grotesk) to avoid
- "genuinely designed for the context" (context-specificity)

This paragraph is masterclass in preventing output convergence.

---

```markdown
**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision.
Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects.
Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention
to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the
vision well.
```

### ✅ **Complexity Matching Guidance**
- Prevents both over-engineering simple designs and under-delivering complex ones
- Provides guidance for both extremes
- "Elegance comes from executing the vision well" (principle)

This is crucial - helps Claude know when to be elaborate vs. restrained.

---

```markdown
Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back,
show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing
fully to a distinctive vision.
```

### ✅ **Empowering Conclusion**
- Recognizes capability ("capable of extraordinary creative work")
- Encourages pushing boundaries ("don't hold back")
- Sets high expectations ("thinking outside the box")
- Positive, energizing tone

This ending is motivational and unlocks ambition.

### Flow Pattern

1. **Frame the problem** (AI slop aesthetics)
2. **Establish philosophy** (intentionality, design thinking)
3. **Provide actionable guidelines** (5 categories)
4. **Prevent mistakes** (anti-patterns)
5. **Encourage variation** (no convergence)
6. **Match complexity** (context-awareness)
7. **Empower** (you can do extraordinary work)

This flow is: Problem → Philosophy → Action → Prevention → Empowerment

---

## Why This Works: Key Techniques

### 1. **Philosophy Before Procedure**
Doesn't jump to "use these fonts" - first establishes "think about purpose, tone, constraints, differentiation"

### 2. **Strong Negative Guidance**
Explicitly names bad patterns (Inter, purple gradients, Space Grotesk)
Most skills miss this - showing what NOT to do is as valuable as showing what to do

### 3. **Variation as Core Requirement**
"No design should be the same"
"NEVER converge on common choices"
Makes variation explicit, not assumed

### 4. **Organized Actionable Content**
Five clear categories (Typography, Color, Motion, Spatial, Backgrounds)
Easy to reference during execution

### 5. **Complexity Guidance**
Tells Claude when to be elaborate (maximalist) vs. restrained (minimalist)
Prevents mismatch between vision and implementation

### 6. **Empowering Tone Throughout**
"BOLD aesthetic direction"
"Extraordinary creative work"
"Don't hold back"
Sets high expectations and encourages ambition

### 7. **Concrete Examples**
Doesn't say "use good fonts" - says "avoid Inter, Roboto, Arial"
Doesn't say "be creative" - says "gradient meshes, noise textures, grain overlays"

### 8. **Balance**
- Freedom (many valid aesthetic directions)
- + Structure (clear categories, principles)
- + Prevention (anti-patterns)
- = Effective guidance without constraining

## Lessons for Skill Creators

From studying frontend-design, we learn:

1. **Start with philosophy, not procedures**
2. **Name specific anti-patterns** - don't just hint
3. **Make variation explicit** - it won't happen automatically
4. **Organize by category** for scannability
5. **Balance freedom and structure** - empower within framework
6. **Set high expectations** - "extraordinary" not "adequate"
7. **Be opinionated** - strong stances guide better than weak suggestions
8. **Stay concise** - 43 lines of high-value content beats 200 lines of fluff
9. **Provide concrete vocabulary** - "gradient meshes, grain overlays" not "visual effects"
10. **End on empowerment** - leave Claude energized, not constrained

---

## Summary

The frontend-design skill works because it:
- **Thinks before doing** (philosophy first)
- **Prevents mistakes** (strong anti-patterns)
- **Encourages diversity** (explicit variation)
- **Stays organized** (clear categories)
- **Empowers creativity** (positive tone)
- **Provides specifics** (concrete examples)

It's a masterclass in skill design - short, powerful, and effective.

**This is the gold standard to emulate.**
